  "course_name": "Human-Computer Interaction in the age of Automation",
  "description": "We are living in the age of automation, where artificial intelligence (AI) is integrated into apps and devices that are woven into our daily lives. Our dependency on automated systems such as expert systems, conversational agents, self-driving cars, and drones in daily tasks will increase in the near future, and will foster new forms of human-automation interaction.How can we design human-automation interactions, which are intuitive, and promote safety, transparency, trust, productivity and wellbeing? How can we design automated systems that promote equity and dignity? What impact will automation have on individuals, communities, and our global society?This course will begin by surveying human-interaction with various automated systems. We will then examine automation as a global issue with impact on privacy, the future of work and wellbeing, and the peril of propagating bias. Finally, we will consider the potential of automation to address global challenges in healthcare, food security, and sustainability.",
