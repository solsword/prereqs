  "course_name": "Linear Algebra",
  "description": "Linear algebra is one of the most beautiful subjects in the undergraduate mathematics curriculum. It is also one of the most important with many possible applications. In this course, students learn computational techniques that have widespread applications in the natural and social sciences as well as in industry, finance, and management. There is also a focus on learning how to understand and write mathematical proofs and an emphasis on improving mathematical style and sophistication. Topics include vector spaces, subspaces, linear independence, bases, dimension, inner products, linear transformations, matrix representations, range and null spaces, inverses, and eigenvalues.",
