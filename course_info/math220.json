  "description": "Probability is the\u00a0mathematics\u00a0of uncertainty.\u00a0 We begin by developing the basic tools of probability theory, including counting techniques, conditional probability, and Bayes's Theorem.\u00a0 We then survey several of the most common discrete and continuous probability distributions (binomial, Poisson, uniform, normal, and exponential, among others) and discuss mathematical modeling using these distributions. Often we cannot calculate probabilities exactly, and we need to approximate them.\u00a0 A powerful tool here is the Central Limit Theorem, which provides the link between probability and statistics.\u00a0 Another strategy when exact results are unavailable is simulation.\u00a0 We examine Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which offer a means of simulating from complicated distributions.",
