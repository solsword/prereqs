  "course_name": "Mobile App Development",
  "description": "Mobile devices have become more popular than desktops or laptops for communicating with others, accessing information, and performing computation. This course covers the principles and practice of developing applications for mobile devices, with an emphasis on features that distinguish them from desktop/laptop applications and web applications. Topics include: the functionality of modern smartphones and tablets, including device sensors, actuators, and communication; an iterative design process for apps that people find both useful and usable; designing and implementing mobile app interfaces and behaviors; and tools for developing software in teams.In this hands-on and programming-intensive course, groups will build mobile apps using a process that combines aspects of Human Computer Interaction and software engineering. This course will start by introducing MIT App Inventor as a mobile app prototyping tool, and will then use a cross-platform mobile app development environment for creating mobile apps that run on both iOS and Android devices.",
