JavaScript is explored in detail, including scoping, closures, objects,\u00a0classes, object-oriented programming, and modules. The jQuery library is also introduced, and the course covers event handling and Ajax interactions.

Designed web pages will be modern, responsive, and accessible. The course also covers Bootstrap and the jQuery UI (User Interface) library.",
