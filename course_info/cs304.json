  "course_name": "Databases with Web Interfaces",
  "description": "A study of the three-layer architecture commonly used for Web-based applications such as e-commerce sites. We will learn to model and design databases using entity-relationship diagrams and the Standard Query Language (SQL) for managing databases. We will work with MySQL for the database tier. We will focus on Flask, a popular Python-based web micro-framework for the middleware. We will learn about implementing features using Ajax. We will review alternative technologies such as Node.js and MongoDB. We will also discuss performance, reliability, \u00a0concurrency, and security issues. Finally, we will create dynamic websites driven by database entries.",
