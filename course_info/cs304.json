We will learn to model and design databases using entity-relationship diagrams and the Standard Query Language (SQL) for managing databases. We will focus on Flask, a popular Python-based web micro-framework, as well as important alternatives such as Node.js. We will learn about implementing features using Ajax. We will also discuss performance, reliability, and security issues. Finally, we will create dynamic websites driven by database entries.Registration is by permission of the instructor only.
