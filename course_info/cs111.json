  "course_name": "Computer Programming and Problem Solving",
  "description": "An introduction to problem-solving through computer programming. Students learn how to read, modify, design, debug, and test algorithms that solve problems. Programming concepts include control structures, data structures, abstraction, recursion, and modularity. Students explore these concepts in the context of interactive programs, data processing, and graphics or audio, using the Python programming language. Students are required to attend an additional two-hour laboratory section each week. Required for students who wish to major or minor in computer science or elect more advanced courses in the field.Please read through this important registration and waitlist information for CS 111.",
