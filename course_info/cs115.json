  "course_name": "Computing for the Socio-Techno Web",
  "description": "Technologies and services made available from Computer Science, such as online environments Facebook, Twitter, and Wikipedia, are integral in today's world. Many problems exist in our real world that transfer to and get amplified in the virtual world created by highly interconnected and ubiquitous computing. What are the basic technologies that enable all this innovation? How do these new environments affect our lives? This course aims to answer these questions through investigation of the socio-techno web. On the technical side we study three languages: HTML5, CSS, and basic JavaScript. We interweave the technical with the social aspects by examining issues introduced by the use of the Social Web. In the process we learn how computers work.",
