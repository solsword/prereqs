        "description": "Video games create compelling digital worlds that resemble our own real-life environments or they can visualize other worldly spaces imagined by their authors. Regardless of their form, these digital spaces are perhaps the most significant element of game design, having a dramatic impact on our initial experience of a game and leaving a lasting memory of our experiences with the gameâ€™s characters and story. Coding for these environments plays a powerful role in shaping the way our player-driven characters can interact with their environments and experience the other characters that inhabit these virtual places. This course will teach students to critically assess these environments, appreciating them as non-neutral spaces that shape characters and the players controlling them. Students will design their own game environments in both two- and three- dimensions, coding elements such as interactivity, physics, and other non-player entities, all of which contribute to the story told by their games.",

        "description": "(tentative description, still under construction) Mobile devices have become more popular than desktops or laptops for communicating with others, accessing information, and performing computation. So learning how to design and implement mobile apps is an important skill for computer scientists. In this hands-on and programming-intensive course, groups will build mobile apps using a process that combines aspects of human-computer interaction and software engineering. This course will briefly introduce MIT App Inventor as a mobile app prototyping tool, and will then use a cross-platform mobile app development environment (such as Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, or Flutter; still to be determined) for creating mobile apps that run on both iOS and Android devices.",
