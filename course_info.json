    "description": "An introduction to problem solving through computer programming. Students learn how to read, modify, design, debug, and test algorithms that solve problems. Programming concepts include control structures, data structures, abstraction, recursion, modularity, and object-oriented design. Students explore these concepts in the context of interactive programs involving graphics and user interfaces using the Python programming language. Students are required to attend an additional two-hour laboratory section each week. Required for students who wish to major or minor in computer science or elect more advanced courses in the field.",

What are the basic technologies that enable all this innovation? How do these new environments affect our lives? This course aims to answer these questions through investigation of the socio-techno web. On the technical side we study three languages: HTML5, CSS, and basic JavaScript. We interweave the technical with the social aspects by examining issues introduced by the use of the Social Web. In the process we learn how computers work.",

    "description": "What is artificial intelligence (AI) and should humans fear it as one of \"our biggest existential threats\"? In this course we will grapple with these difficult questions and investigate them in different ways. We will follow the history of AI from Alan Turing's \"Can Machines Think?\" seminal paper to the recent Elon Musk musings on AI's threat to mankind. We will discuss the underlying theory of the symbolic, knowledge-rich approaches of the 20th century AI (e.g., rule-based systems) and the 21st century approaches relying on statistical learning from large amounts of data (e.g., machine learning algorithms). Finally, we will dissect some of the AI applications in modern life: personal assistant technology like Alexa and Siri, machine translation (Google Translate), and self-autonomous cars. By the end of the semester, students should be able to answer the starting questions in depth and with nuance.",

In this course, students will initially learn how to collect, clean, format, and store data from digital platforms. By adopting a computational approach to statistical analysis, students will then implement in code different statistical metrics and simulation scenarios for hypothesis testing and estimation. Finally, students will generate meaningful visualizations for data exploration and communicating results. Additionally, we will discuss the ethics of data collection and think critically about current practices of experimenting with online users. Students will work in groups to create their own datasets, ask an interesting question, perform statistical analyses and visualizations, and report the results.To pre-register for CS 234, please visit this link\u00a0http://bit.ly/cs234fa20\u00a0to fill out the form.

This course is a broad introduction to the field, covering the theoretical ideas behind widely used algorithms like support vector machines, neural networks, graphical models, decision trees, and many more. We will also study practical applications of these algorithms to problems in vision, speech, language, biology, and the social sciences.",

How are such systems built? What algorithms underlie their foundations? How does human behavior influence their operation and vice-versa? In this class, we will delve into answering these questions by means of: a) reading current research papers on the inner-workings of such systems; b) implementing algorithms that accomplish tasks such as web crawling, web search, random walks, learning to rank, text classification, topic modeling; and c) critically thinking about the unexamined embrace of techno-solutionism using a humanistic lens.To pre-register for CS 315, please visit this link\u00a0http://bit.ly/cs315fa20\u00a0to fill out the form.

Often we cannot calculate probabilities exactly, and we need to approximate them.\u00a0 A powerful tool here is the Central Limit Theorem, which provides the link between probability and statistics.\u00a0 Another strategy when exact results are unavailable is simulation.\u00a0 We examine Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which offer a means of simulating from complicated distributions.",
