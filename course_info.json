How are such systems built? What algorithms underlie their foundations? How does human behavior influence their operation and vice-versa?

    "description": "As the number of our digital traces continues to grow, so does the opportunity for discovering meaningful patterns in these traces. In this course, students will initially learn how to collect, clean, format, and store data from digital platforms. By adopting a computational approach to statistical analysis, students will then implement in code different statistical metrics and simulation scenarios for hypothesis testing and estimation. Finally, students will generate meaningful visualizations for data exploration and communicating results. Additionally, we will discuss the ethics of data collection and think critically about current practices of experimenting with online users. Students will work in groups to create their own datasets, ask an interesting question, perform statistical analyses and visualizations, and report the results.To pre-register for CS 234, please visit this link\u00a0http://bit.ly/cs234fa20\u00a0to fill out the form.

    "description": "What is artificial intelligence (AI) and should humans fear it as one of \"our biggest existential threats\"? In this course we will grapple with these difficult questions and investigate them in different ways. We will follow the history of AI from Alan Turing's \"Can Machines Think?\" seminal paper to the recent Elon Musk musings on AI's threat to mankind. We will discuss the underlying theory of the symbolic, knowledge-rich approaches of the 20th century AI (e.g., rule-based systems) and the 21st century approaches relying on statistical learning from large amounts of data (e.g., machine learning algorithms). Finally, we will dissect some of the AI applications in modern life: personal assistant technology like Alexa and Siri, machine translation (Google Translate), and self-autonomous cars. By the end of the semester, students should be able to answer the starting questions in depth and with nuance.",

Our dependency on automated systems such as expert systems, conversational agents, self-driving cars, and drones in daily tasks will increase in the near future, and will foster new forms of human-automation interaction.How can we design human-automation interactions, which are intuitive, and promote safety, transparency, trust, productivity and wellbeing? How can we design automated systems that promote equity and dignity? What impact will automation have on individuals, communities, and our global society?This course will begin by surveying human-interaction with various automated systems. We will then examine automation as a global issue with impact on privacy, the future of work and wellbeing, and the peril of propagating bias.
