Programming concepts include control structures, data structures, abstraction, recursion, modularity, and object-oriented design. Students explore these concepts in the context of interactive programs involving graphics and user interfaces using the Python programming language. Students are required to attend an additional two-hour laboratory section each week. Required for students who wish to major or minor in computer science or elect more advanced courses in the field.",

This course aims to answer these questions through investigation of the socio-techno web. On the technical side we study three languages: HTML5, CSS, and basic JavaScript. We interweave the technical with the social aspects by examining issues introduced by the use of the Social Web. In the process we learn how computers work.",

This course will introduce students to video game production and concepts. We will develop a framework for critically analyzing this medium, learn to identify effective strategies for creating games and describe what elements of design impact the final experience of a game. We\u2019ll also identify the function of user agency in this medium to better understand how players are affected by representation in video games. Throughout the course, students will be asked to apply these concepts while building their own games and become familiar with the fundamentals of video game design.",

    "description": "What is artificial intelligence (AI) and should humans fear it as one of \"our biggest existential threats\"? In this course we will grapple with these difficult questions and investigate them in different ways. We will follow the history of AI from Alan Turing's \"Can Machines Think?\" seminal paper to the recent Elon Musk musings on AI's threat to mankind. We will discuss the underlying theory of the symbolic, knowledge-rich approaches of the 20th century AI (e.g., rule-based systems) and the 21st century approaches relying on statistical learning from large amounts of data (e.g., machine learning algorithms). Finally, we will dissect some of the AI applications in modern life: personal assistant technology like Alexa and Siri, machine translation (Google Translate), and self-autonomous cars. By the end of the semester, students should be able to answer the starting questions in depth and with nuance.",

In this course, students will initially learn how to collect, clean, format, and store data from digital platforms. By adopting a computational approach to statistical analysis, students will then implement in code different statistical metrics and simulation scenarios for hypothesis testing and estimation. Finally, students will generate meaningful visualizations for data exploration and communicating results. Additionally, we will discuss the ethics of data collection and think critically about current practices of experimenting with online users. Students will work in groups to create their own datasets, ask an interesting question, perform statistical analyses and visualizations, and report the results.To pre-register for CS 234, please visit this link\u00a0http://bit.ly/cs234fa20\u00a0to fill out the form.

It is ubiquitous in our interactions with society, showing up in face recognition, web search, targeted advertising, speech processing, genetic analysis, and even Facebook's selection of posts to display. It is currently at the forefront of research in artificial intelligence, and has been making rapid strides given the vast availability of data today. This course is a broad introduction to the field, covering the theoretical ideas behind widely used algorithms like support vector machines, neural networks, graphical models, decision trees, and many more. We will also study practical applications of these algorithms to problems in vision, speech, language, biology, and the social sciences.",

How are such systems built? What algorithms underlie their foundations? How does human behavior influence their operation and vice-versa? In this class, we will delve into answering these questions by means of: a) reading current research papers on the inner-workings of such systems; b) implementing algorithms that accomplish tasks such as web crawling, web search, random walks, learning to rank, text classification, topic modeling; and c) critically thinking about the unexamined embrace of techno-solutionism using a humanistic lens.To pre-register for CS 315, please visit this link\u00a0http://bit.ly/cs315fa20\u00a0to fill out the form.

How can we design automated systems that promote equity and dignity? What impact will automation have on individuals, communities, and our global society?This course will begin by surveying human-interaction with various automated systems.

Regardless of their form, these digital spaces are perhaps the most significant element of game design, having a dramatic impact on our initial experience of a game and leaving a lasting memory of our experiences with the game’s characters and story. Coding for these environments plays a powerful role in shaping the way our player-driven characters can interact with their environments and experience the other characters that inhabit these virtual places. This course will teach students to critically assess these environments, appreciating them as non-neutral spaces that shape characters and the players controlling them. Students will design their own game environments in both two- and three- dimensions, coding elements such as interactivity, physics, and other non-player entities, all of which contribute to the story told by their games.",
